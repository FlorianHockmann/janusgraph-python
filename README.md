# JanusGraph-Python

## Python Client drivers for [JanusGraph](http://janusgraph.org)

JanusGraph-Python is the Python driver for connecting to JanusGraph. 
It extends Apache TinkerPopâ„¢'s [Gremlin-Python](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-python) 
as its core dependency with additional support for JanusGraph-specific types and predicates.
